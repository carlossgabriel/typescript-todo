
# Another To-Do list

This is a simple typescript project to learn the basics of typescript based on the book
[Essential TypeScript 4: From Beginner to Pro, Second Edition](https://github.com/Apress/essential-typescript-4)

The main purpose was to create a todo list following the examples from the book.

The code uses lowdb to create a simple local database using a JSON file and the inquirer package to interate with the terminal.
